## Description

 Incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Instructions

To install:
1. Clone or download (ZIP file) the repository using the green clone or download button on the right side of the screen.
2. Navigate to the location of the clone or unZIPped file on your computer via the terminal.
3. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

<!--Project page can't be viewed b/c there is no Python server running (I think)  -->

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

## Contributing

This repository is forked from the starter code for _all_ Udacity students, my version of a popular assignment. Therefore,
I most likely will not accept pull requests.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, I tried to maintain use of ES6 in the additional JavaScript I wrote.
